# FactWise React Js Challenge 😎

## Goals / Outcomes ✨

- Display the current date (initially loaded from JSON file)
- On the left of the current date, have a “-“ (minus) button. This will decrease the current date by 1
- On the right of the current date, have a “+“ (plus) button. This will increase the current date by 1.
- Display a summary sentence near the top of the page which says “X out of Y people have been vaccinated”. Here, “Y” is the total number of people in the vaccine_dates.json file, and “X” is the number of people who have been vaccinated (vaccine date <= displayed current date)
- Display a pie chart to display the % of people who have been vaccinated
- Show a table of users with two columns, “Name” and “Vaccination Status”
  - The Vaccination Status should say “Vaccine Done” in GREEN COLOR if vaccination date <= displayed current date
  - The Vaccination Status should say “Vaccine Pending” in RED COLOR if vaccination date > displayed current date
- When the date changes, the summary, pie chart and table should all get updated.
- Please add whatever components and styling you need.
- Grading criteria: Correctness, functionality, code quality, styling/alignment/formatting
